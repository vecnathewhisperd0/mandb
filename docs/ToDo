In progress:

* store .so link in the db.
* reduce wasted/duplicated text stored within the databases.
  10-20% database size reduction so far.
* execute pipelines inline rather than using the shell.

In need of attention:

* clear up the use of troff and/or groff
* complete configuration file redesign to allow better dynamic determination 
  of programs/paths/extensions etc.
* use zlib for gzipped pages rather than forking gzip.
* look at work done by SuSE and Andries.

Case-insensitive lookup transition:

* Solaris layout is broken.
* Finish off db version transition, and test heavily.
* Need to make sure pointers trigger an exact-case lookup [done for whatis].

Apparently db3's compatibility API is, er, less than compatible.
(Specifically, it isn't possible to write correct error-handling code that
works in the compatibility API, nor that works in both db2 and db3.) I
suppose I have to write a db_newbdb.c now.

Need to clean up the code that decides where cat files go (see display*()).
Debian bug #129575 is difficult to fix otherwise.
